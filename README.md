Nonparemetric statistical study on construction project performance.
Submitted as term paper for Stanford University's Stats 205 (Nonparametric Statistics) in Spring 2016.

## Abstract
Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) consists of many useful tools to assist a construction project, including modeling technologies, process management tools, and collaboration methodologies. VDC usage data collected from 143 real construction project cases was used to predict the final performance of the project, and the best model achieved a 78.2% accuracy. However, more in-depth study of individual VDC uses is required to better understand the relationship between specific VDC use and the project outcome. Such understanding will ultimately help construction project managers apply VDC optimally to improve performance. This study tests the difference in 4 VDC uses between projects that performed well and projects that only had mediocre performance. Surprisingly, only the level of VDC formalization was found to be significantly different between the two groups, and the mediocre performance group actually adopted higher level of formalization. Further exploratory visualizations suggest substantial multiplicative effect among these 4 VDC uses, and future studies should take into account of more complex relationship between VDC use and project performance.

## Overview
- The data was collected from 108 worldwide construction project case studies with 50 features in Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) as part of the research project at the Center for Intergrated Facility Engineering, Stanford University.
